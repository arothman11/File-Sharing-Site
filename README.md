Here is the link to our filesharing site: http://ec2-3-14-152-126.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com/~emcclanahan/module2-group-464202-475030/main.php?

The users.txt file in this repo shows usernames that you can sign in as. Try "arothman11", "emilymcclanahan", or "compscistudent" for example. You can also choose to make a new account and create your own username.

For our creative portion, we implemented three things:
1. Files can be sorted alphabetically by clicking a button. We hope this makes files easier to locate for users who have a lot of files.
2. You can create new users by clicking a button on the sign in page and inputing a new username. If the username has already been taken, you will need to enter a different one.
3. You can delete your account after logging in. This will delete all of the user's files as well. Once an account is deleted, you can make a new account under the same name, but old files cannot be restored.
